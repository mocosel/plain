Semantics

    Statement

        As in <Node> (see <Syntax>).

    Program

        As in <List> (see <Syntax>).

    Argument

        As in <Data> (see <Syntax>) with the following substitutions.

        Expression

            <Node>, or simply a "statement that returns a value" or "statement
            substitution".

        Variable

            <Keyword>, or simply a "keyword that contains a value" or "keyword
            substitution".

            In fact, variables can contain any values. So far, there are only
            two additional data types: subroutines and arbitrary pointers.
