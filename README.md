Plain is the implementation of arguably the lightest functional programming language for general use. Written purely in C to prove memory efficiency, weightlessness and platform independence, fits in every pocket.

### Mocosel, Plain and Plain SDK ###

Mocosel is a programming language, originally designed and maintained by [Nerijus Ramanauskas](mailto:nerijus.ramanauskas@mocosel.org). Plain is the first implementation of the language. Plain SDK is a collection of tools, neccessary to build an application.

### Why Mocosel? ###

* Mocosel is meant to be functional, while still allowing casual imperative expressions.
* As powerful as [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)), looks tidier, though.
* Easy to learn, like no joke: a couple of keywords, very few symbols and unbeliavably short specification (semantics).

### Why Plain? Goals ###

* Very little overhead.
* Incredibly tiny and elegant. We guarantee, you'll see what [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) is actually about!
* Platform independence, no third party libraries, very little of the Standard Library.
* Maximum extensibility and [hackability](http://www.slideshare.net/nitot/hackability-what-it-means-why-its-important) (without even touching the implementation).
* All efforts on truly parallel computing, execution without locking or stuff.
